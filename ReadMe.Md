mse6 is designed to test the resilience of your http client. It's a mock HTTP/TLS server that responds with 
abnormal behaviour such as slow HTTP responses, bad content encoding, sudden crashes, network termination 
that are otherwise difficult to consistently reproduce under test conditions.

## Routes
`GET /mse6/badcontentlength`
Sends invalid content length header, too large for response

`GET /mse6/badgzip`
Sends a response gzip content encoding header and garbled binary

`GET /mse6/brotli`
Sends a response with br content encoding header and brotli encoded binary response

`CONNECT /mse6/connect?body=true`
Sends a HTTP 200 OK response to the HTTP connect method. Has no bearing on network connection other than standard keepalive.
Will send (illegal) body if body=true

`GET /mse6/choose`
Sends a HTTP response to the client with one of the following content encodings: `br`, `gzip`, `deflate` or `identity` 
Content encoding preference is in above order and depends on values found in `Accept-Encoding` header found on request. 

`GET /mse6/chunked`
Sends a chunked HTTP/1.1 response to the client

`DELETE /mse6/delete`
Standard json response with status code 204

`GET /mse6/deflate`
sends a deflate encoded response

`GET /mse6/echoheader`
echoes all request headers sent on response body for testing

`GET /mse6/echoquery`
echoes all query string values sent with request on response body for testing

`GET /mse6/echoport`
sends a response with the http port the server is listening on

`GET /mse6/formget`
simulates a form GET by echoing the raw request

`POST /mse6/formpost`
simulates a form POST by echoing the raw request. Supports both `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
and `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`

`GET /mse6/get`
Standard json response with status code 200

`HEAD /mse6/getorhead?cl=y`
`GET /mse6/getorhead`
Sends a HTTP HEAD response or a GET response, depending on request method.
If query param cl is appended with any value, the Content-Length header of 
the body otherwise sent by GET is also included in the HEAD response

`GET /mse6/gzip`
Sends a gzipped response with proper content encoding

`GET /mse6/hangupduringheader`
Sends a partial header only response, waits 2s, then closes the TCP connection.

`GET /mse6/hangupafterheader`
Sends a complete header only response message , waits 2s, then closes the TCP connection.

`GET /mse6/hangupduringbody`
Sends a complete header message, then some of the body, waits 2s, then closes the TCP connection.

`GET /mse6/jwks`
sends a list of RS256 Jwks keys

`GET /mse6/jwksmix`
sends a list of mixed algorithm Jwks keys

`GET /mse6/jwkses256`
sends a JWKS key of type ES256

`GET /mse6/jwksbad`
sends illegally formatted Jwks key

`GET /mse6/jwksrotate`
sends a rotating Jwks keys that change arbitrarily.

`GET /mse6/jwksbadrotate?rc=0`
sends a rotating Jwks key that alternates every request. Sends malformed keys. Stateful method, reset good behaviour with rc=0

`GET /mse6/nocontentenc`
Sends a HTTP response without a content encoding header set

`OPTIONS /mse6/options?code=n&body=true`
Sends a HTTP OPTIONS response as per RFC7231, section 4.3.7. Contains Allow headers and a status code.

`POST /mse6/post`
Standard json response with status code 201

`PUT /mse6/put`
Standard json response with status code 200

`GET /mse6/send?code=nnn&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com`
Sends arbitrary response code between 100 and 999. For redirects, you can supply a custom
location parameter. Don't forget to URL encode your params.

`GET /mse6/slowheader?wait=n`
Sends headers but only after waiting for n seconds. 
Alternatively configure default with -w=n on cli

`GET /mse6/slowbody?wait=n`
Sends body after initial lag of n/2s, then sends remaining body without chunking after n/2s. 
Alternatively configure default with -w=n on cli

`TRACE /mse6/trace`
Standard json response with status code 200 and "message/http" content type.
Sends boilerplate trace response in body, not actual request echo.

`GET /mse6/tiny`
Tiny JSON response with content encoding identity

`GET /mse6/tinygzip`
Tiny JSON response with content encoding gzip

`GET /mse6/unknowncontentenc`
Sends unknown content-encoding header with json response.


`GET /mse6/websocket?n=1&c=true&c1=true&c2=true`
Upgrade the client connection to a HTTP/1.1 websocket that echoes messages sent to it.
Specify n for how often the echo should repeat. Specify c to orderly close the connection
from the server side after sending all echo responses. Specify c1 to only send websocket
protocol close. Specify c2 to only hang up on TCP connection, without respecting websocket protocol.
